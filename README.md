# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

This repository contains code and resources for a competition task aimed at developing an algorithm for the detection of metastatic cancer in small image patches extracted from digital pathology scans. The dataset used in this project is based on the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset, with modifications to remove duplicate images.
